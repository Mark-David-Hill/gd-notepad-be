# Backend not starting up issues (2025-08-10 23:38Z)

My backend isn't spinning up

I can see the issue! You're getting a PostgreSQL/psycopg2 import error. This is a common problem on macOS where the psycopg2 binary is incompatible with your system. Let me help you fix this.


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: Pipfile

---

The issue is with `psycopg2-binary`. On macOS, especially with newer versions, the binary package often has compatibility issues. Let's fix this by replacing it with `psycopg2` (the source version) or using `psycopg2-binary` with a specific version that works better on macOS.


---

Tool use: **search_replace**

Now let's reinstall the dependencies with the fixed version:

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
pipenv install

Great! The dependencies have been updated. Now let's try running your backend again:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
python app.py demo-data
```

```
markhill@mac gd-notepad-be % python app.py demo-data
zsh: command not found: python
```

---

It looks like we need to activate the virtual environment first. Let me do that:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
pipenv shell
```

```
markhill@mac gd-notepad-be % pipenv shell
Loading .env environment variables...

(gd-notepad-be) markhill@mac gd-notepad-be %
```

---

Perfect! Now we're in the virtual environment. Let's try running your backend again:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
python app.py demo-data
```

```
(gd-notepad-be) markhill@mac gd-notepad-be % python app.py demo-data

Excellent! Your backend is now running successfully! ðŸŽ‰

The issue was with the `psycopg2-binary` package version. I fixed it by:

1. **Updated the Pipfile** to use a specific version of `psycopg2-binary` (2.9.7) that's more compatible with macOS
2. **Reinstalled dependencies** with `pipenv install`
3. **Activated the virtual environment** with `pipenv shell`

Your Flask backend is now running on `http://127.0.0.1:8086` and has successfully:
- Created the database tables
- Loaded demo data
- Started the development server

The warning about `.env` files is just a suggestion - you can install `python-dotenv` if you want to use environment variables from `.env` files, but it's not required for the app to function.

Your backend should now be ready to accept requests! You can test it by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8086` in your browser or making API calls to it.

That worked!

Fantastic! ðŸŽ‰ I'm glad we got your backend up and running successfully. 

The psycopg2 compatibility issue on macOS is a common problem, and pinning to a specific version (2.9.7) usually resolves it. Your Flask backend is now ready to handle requests on port 8086.

If you need to start the backend again in the future, just remember to:
1. Activate the virtual environment: `pipenv shell`
2. Run the app: `python app.py demo-data`

Is there anything else you'd like to work on with your backend, or are you ready to move on to other parts of your project?
