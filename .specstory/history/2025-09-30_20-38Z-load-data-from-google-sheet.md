# Load data from Google Sheet (2025-09-30 20:38Z)

_**User (2025-10-06 14:45Z)**_

When the ExternalCollections components mounts I want it to automatically load the data from the google sheet at this link:

@https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aYK-0RBzHnzvZKmVjWwwbfmPqY29f6SnyjfT8InQf10/edit?usp=sharing 

And then console log the data it receives. There is only one tab, and it has a table with these columns:
collection_id	name	description	image_url	sheet_url

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to load data from a Google Sheets document when an "ExternalCollections" component mounts. However, I'm looking at a backend Flask application (Python), not a frontend React/Vue/etc application.

Let me check what files exist to understand the codebase better. The project appears to be a Flask backend application based on the structure (app.py, controllers, models, routes).

The user mentioned "ExternalCollections components mounts" which sounds like a frontend component. However, this is a backend repository. Let me search for any frontend code or any reference to ExternalCollections.

I should:
1. Search for ExternalCollections in the codebase
2. Check if there's any frontend code in this repository
3. If not, clarify with the user or create an appropriate solution

Let me search for ExternalCollections first.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see this is a Flask backend application (Python) but the user is asking about a component called "ExternalCollections" that should mount and load data from Google Sheets. This sounds like they're referring to a frontend component, but I'm in the backend repository.

There are a few possibilities:
1. The user wants me to create a backend API endpoint that fetches data from Google Sheets
2. The user is in the wrong repository and meant to work on the frontend
3. The user wants me to create the frontend component in this backend repository

Given the context and the fact that this is clearly a backend repo, I think the most likely scenario is that the user wants me to create a backend endpoint that can fetch data from the Google Sheet and return it. However, since they specifically mentioned "when the ExternalCollections component mounts", they might be confused about which repository they're working in.

Let me ask for clarification about whether they want:
1. A backend API endpoint to fetch Google Sheets data
2. Or if they're actually working on a frontend repo

But wait, let me check if there's a frontend directory or something similar.</details></think>

I notice this is a Flask backend repository (`gd-notepad-be`), but you're asking about a component mounting (which sounds like frontend React/Vue code). 

Let me clarify: Do you want me to:

1. **Create a backend API endpoint** in this Flask app that fetches the Google Sheets data and returns it?
2. Or are you working on a **frontend repository** and asked in the wrong directory?

If you want a backend endpoint, I can create:
- A new route/controller to fetch data from the Google Sheets API
- An endpoint like `/external-collections` that your frontend can call
- The backend will fetch the sheet data and return it as JSON

If you're actually working on the frontend, you might want to switch to your frontend repository (perhaps `gd-notepad-fe` or similar).

Which would you like me to help with?
